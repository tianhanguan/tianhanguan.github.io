        <h1>Sentiment analysis for text data using RNN with LSTM</h1>
        <img src="images/DL2/Picture.PNG" width="500" height="300" alt="A beautiful picture">

        <p>Compared to densely connected (feed forward) neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have better
            capability to model sequence data (such as text and time series data) by maintaining an internal
            loop over sequence elements. This project explores how to use RNN with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
            layers to perform a sentiment analysis task on the Roman Urdu text data.
            The goal is to develop some guidelines and insights
            as how to apply deep learning methods to process text data.
            Models are built using Keras.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
        <p>Sentiment analysis is a popular field of natural language processing which involves identify and
            extract opinions/emotions from text data. It has important applications in areas such as customer
            reviews and survey responses, from customer marketing to health care.

            In machine learning, sentiment analysis can be handled by any type of classifiers (e.g.
            SVM, logistic regression, tree models, neural networks, etc). However, as text data is usually big and
            complex, deep learning has been very popular for sentiment analysis. This project focuses on the
            deep learning approach and uses a few other types of models as baseline benchmarks.
        </p>

        <h2>Process Text Data</h2>
        <p>Compared to structured data, the first step to work with text data is to tokenize/vectorize them so that
            they can be used as input for the machine learning algorithms. Traditionally, feature engineering tools
            such as N-grams are powerful for many of the "shallow" learning methods but is not appropriate for
            deep learning models, mainly because the bag-of-words method doesn't preserve the global ordering pattern
            (tokens generated form a set but not sequence). For this project, the word embedding method is used to
            tokenize the texts. Note that compared to the one-hot-encoding method (which is popular for encode
            categorical data), word embeddings are learning from the actual data - they create vectors that are
            dense, low-dimensional, and tend to reflect the semantic relationship between words. </p>

        <p>The text data in this project is the Roman Urdu text dataset, which contains more than 20,000 comments
            (in Roman scripts) with labels (negative, neutral, or positive). Note that some of the comments have
            special characters (for example, happy faces, empty squares, etc.), these characters are included in the
            comments (therefore maybe included in the vocabulary list).</p>

            <img src="images/DL2/Data.JPG" width="600" height="400" alt="A beautiful picture"><br/>

        <p>It should be noted that the class labels are not evenly distributed (most of the comments are neutral),
            however, because the imbalance is not very significant, no oversampling/undersampling is done. Also note
            that the comments have various length, some are very short and some are very long. In this task,
            only the first 100 words are considered for each comment.</p>

            <img src="images/DL2/EDA2.JPG" width="600" height="400" alt="A beautiful picture">

        <p>The vocabulary list only considers the top 10,000 words. Note that in total there are more than 30,000
            unique tokens in the dataset. Using only the frequent words avoid the word embeddings to be too noisy.</p>

        <h2>Baseline Models</h2>
        <p>Before building RNN models, three baseline or alternative models are built. This step
        is important as the final RNN model can only be accepted if it can beat the performance of the cheaper and
        simpler alternative models. For this problem, the following three types of models are used as baselines:

                <ol>*. Random Guess (naive baseline)- accuracy of 36%</ol>
                <ol>1. Multinomial Logistic Regression - accuracy of 44% <br/></ol>
                <ol>2. SVM (One vs All) - accuracy of 44%</ol>
                <ol>3. Gradient Boosting - accuracy of 54%</ol>
        </p>
        <hr/>


       <h2>Densely Connected Networks </h2>
        <p>Before  building a RNN, a simple DNN model (with a single layer) is built to see the performance
            of ignoring the sequence pattern of the data. </p>

        <img src="images/DL2/DNN1.JPG" width="600" height="400" alt="A beautiful picture">

        <p>The model starts to overfit after 2 epochs. A regularized version using dropout is then built. </p>

        <img src="images/DL2/DNN2.JPG" width="600" height="400" alt="A beautiful picture">

        <p>With the regularization added, less overfitting is seen. It is noticed that the validation accuracy stops
            improving after 10 epochs (stays flat around 65%).</p>

        <p>The regularized model is fit again and used on the test data. An accuracy of 61% is seen on the test data.
            The soft probability distribution for each class is plotted as below. </p>

        <h2>Recurrent Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>Three RNN models have been built for this case. The first model contains a single small LSTM layer. The
        second model contains a single bigger LSTM layer. The third model contains two LSTM layers. Regularization
        using dropout is applied to all three models. From the plots below, it can be seen that the performance is
        very similar on the validation set - increasing the complexity does not improve the predictive power.</p>

        <img src="images/DL2/RNN4.JPG" width="600" height="400" alt="A beautiful picture"> </br>

        <p>Overfitting is seen in all three models.  An accuracy of 63% is seen on the test data for all three models,
            which has a small improvement compared to the feed-forward network (with 61% accuracy).
            The soft probability distribution for each class is plotted as below.</p>

        <h2>Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>A bidirectional RNN is a popular tool in many NLP tasks, it consists of two regular (one directional)
        RNNs which process the data in opposite directions, and then combing their representations together.</p>

        <img src="images/DL2/BRNN1.JPG" width="600" height="400" alt="A beautiful picture"> </br>

        <p>In this case, the bidirectional RNN show similar performance as the regular RNNs. However, it takes
        much longer time to train the model (as its complexity is much higher). In this case, it possibly means
        that reading the comments backward does not show any significant new pattern.
        </p>

        <p>Here are some general remarks on bidirectional RNNs.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>In some cases, a bidirectional RNN can capture more complex patterns than a regular RNN
                    (as it looks at the data from another angle and exploits the data more -
                    similar to ensemble learning).
                </li><br/>

                <li>Although bidirectional RNNs are useful on many NLP problems, they are less useful for time series
                    data predictions (where the recent past is more important than ancient past - which is very common
                    for many time series data).
                </li><br/>
            </ul>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Two important points can be concluded from the analysis. First, deep learning models are performing much
            better on this text data - compared other "shallow learning" methods. Second, various types of RNN models
            do not significantly outperform the densely connected networks (only small improvement). Here are some
            possible explanations on why LSTM is not performing much better.
        </p>


            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>LSTM is designed to capture global (long-term) ordering patterns in the data (for example, a long
                    paragraph of a book or a long documentation). However, in this case, we know the comments are
                    relatively short sequences (on average only 68 words long and half of the comments are less
                    than 38 words
                    long). As a result, LSTM will not be particularly useful for this sentiment analysis problem
                    although it still performs slightly better than the fully connected network.
                </li><br/>

                <li>For this particular sentiment analysis task, probably the most efficient way to classify a comment
                    is to look at what words occur in a comment and how frequent it occurs (for example, good,
                    happy face, etc.). This job can also be done efficiently by the densely connected network. This is
                    probably why the densely connected network is also performing well on this problem.
                </li><br/>
            </ul>
