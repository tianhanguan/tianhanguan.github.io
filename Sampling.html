        <h1>Association between screen time and depression: a population-based study using the 2011-2012
            national health and nutrition examination sample</h1>

        <p>The goal is to replicate (and extend) some of the analysis results in the research question
            that has been studied
            by K.C. Madhava et al. (2017) in their paper Association between screen time and depression among US adults
            which used the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (NHANES) sample data where it
            concluded that there was an association between people who spent more than 4 hours per day on TV/computer
            with experiencing moderate or severe depression. Various survey sampling techniques are implemented throughout
            the analysis.

            <br/><br/>The most important (and difficult) part is to obtain the variance estimates for the interested
            quantities (population proportions).

        <h2>Four-Stage Sampling Design</h2>
        <p>The study of this report is conducted using the sample from the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition
            Examination survey (NHANES), a large cross-sectional U.S. survey conducted by the Centers for Disease
            Control (CDC) and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The sampling design consists of
                four stages which is quite complex and is summarized as follows:
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Stage 1: Selecting PSUs from a frame of all U.S. counties</li>
                <li>Stage 2: Selecting area segments from each PSU</li>
                <li>Stage 3: Selecting households from each area segment</li>
                <li>Stage 4: Selecting persons within each household</li>
            </ul>

            In addition, the following two points are also important:
              <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Each individual has a sample weight assigned which represents the number of people in the
                    study population in NHANES. The design uses unequal probability of selection
                    (which means the sample weights are different for each sampled individual)
                    in order to produce an unbiased estimate for the nation</li>
                <li>Oversampling is a common approach in large survey sampling designs which is used to adjust the
                    distribution of subsamples of a sample dataset, so that the bias in estimations can be corrected.
                    Here, NHANES uses oversampling to sample more individuals from certain subgroups for
                    particular health interest so that the precision of estimates about the health information for
                    these subgroups can be improved</li>
                 <li>Finally, because the survey only covers a short period of time, longitudinal techniques
                 are not involved</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <h2>Estimation of population proportions using the sample data</h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Analysis 1: Weighted analysis</li>
                <li>Analysis 2. Unweighted analysis</li>
                <li>For each analysis, descriptive statistics of the study population are computed include
                estimated population proportions, their standard errors, and Rao-Scott chi-square test with
                    second order corrections (which corrects both mean and variance) to test the association
                    between depression and the study variables.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        It is noted that the estimates and their standard errors are significantly different between the weighted
            and unweighted analyses. This makes sense as the NHANES sampling design uses unequal probability selection
            where the sample weights are different to reflect the number of people in the population that they represent.
            In this case, using an unweighted analysis will be inappropriate as equal sample probability increases
            the bias of the estimates as well as decreases the precision of the estimates. This is particularly true
            for categories that involves a lot of oversampling.
        <hr/>

         <h2>Statistical analysis</h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Univariate logistic regression - Unadjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals</li>
                <li>Multivariate logistic regression - Adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals</li>
            </ul>
