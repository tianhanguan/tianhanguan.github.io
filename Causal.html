        <h1>Understanding statistical paradoxes using causal graphical models</h1>
        <img src="images/Causal/Picture.JPG" width="500" height="300" alt="A beautiful picture">

        <p>At the root of scientific explanations, causal inference plays a significant role in many fields such as
            social studies, economics, and artificial intelligence. However, making causal conclusions in many cases
            can be very challenging as in general causation is not the same as association and making decisions solely
            based on statistical methods can be counterintuitive and misleading. This project focuses a few famous
            statistical paradoxes and discusses how causal inference techniques can be used to explain those.
            Among the many causal inference frameworks, the project focuses on the causal graphical model which
            is widely used in econometrics and artificial intelligence.
            Both the backdoor and frontdoor adjustment formulas are discussed as how they can be applied to
            resolve the paradoxes through simulated observational data examples.

        <h2><b>Closing Thoughts</b></h2>

        <img src="images/Causal/Picture2.JPG" width="500" height="300" alt="A beautiful picture">

        <p>Causal inference is a very interesting and important field as it plays a role in almost all fields, especially
            applied statistics and computer science. However, it is very easy to confuse causal inference with
            statistical inference without thinking thoroughly on many problems. I did find it is very useful to use
            graphical models for causal inference problems as they are intuitive and easy to understand. In this project
            I only focus on observational data (as it is more common in econometric analysis), but causal inference
            is also very useful (probably more useful) in randomized studies as in many biostatistics contexts.
