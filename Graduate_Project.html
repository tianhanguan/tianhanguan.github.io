        <p>This project focuses on how to use various modeling techniques to calculate risk capitals, and in particular,
            how to improve the goodness-of-fit of the models and capture the dependence structure in high-dimensional
            settings. Applications include severity-frequency models.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Historically, many risk models have been developed to deal with complicated high-dimensional data, one
            example is the the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) model under Basel II for operational risk capital
            calculations. However, there are two major concerns about the these risk models:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Different risk models could have very different goodness-of-fit results especially for heavy-tailed
                    data, and their predictive powers cannot be standardized.</li>
                <li>Capturing the dependence structure in high-dimensional problems is very challenging. One common
                    approach is to use some type of copula model. However, the pre-determined nature of a copula
                    model can limit its ability to capture extremely complicated dependence structure of very
                    high-dimensional data.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>The purpose of this project is to deal with the above two questions by investigating two types of multivariate
            models.
        </p>
        <hr/>


        <h2>Model 1 Multivariate Pascal Mixture and Mixture of Erlangs</h2>
        <p>The first model assumes that dependency can be captured at the frequency level of the data, and attempts to
            capture the dependence structure using a multivariate mixed frequency model - the Multivariate Pascal Mixture
            model. The severity in each marginal is fitted using an univariate Mixture of Erlangs model.
        </p>

        <p><b>Desirable distributional properties of the Mixture of Erlangs model</b>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>It is dense in the space of positive distributions, i.e. any continuous distribution can be
                    approximated by a mixture of Erlangs to any accuracy. This will make the capital numbers to be much
                    more stable from period to period.</li>
                <li>It is closed under mixture, convolution, and compounding, and this will make the estimation of
                    certain statistical quantities much easier.</li>
                <li>Multimodal heavy-tailed data can be fitted easily .</li>
                <li>Censored/truncated data can also be handled.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><b>Desirable distributional properties of the Multivariate Pascal Mixture model</b>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Any p-variate marginal is also a p-variate Pascal Mixture. </li>
                <li>Multimodal count data can be fitted easily .</li>
                <li>Censored/truncated data can also be handled.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><b>Model Fitting</b><br/>
            As both models are mixture-type latent variable models, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm can be
            used to fit the model parameters.

        </p>
        <hr/>


        <h2>Model 2 Multivariate Mixture of Erlangs</h2>
        <p>The second model assumes that dependency can be captured at the aggregate level of the data, and attempts to
            capture the dependence structure using a Multivariate Mixture of Erlangs. This is more challenging as
            it avoids fitting the frequency and severity data separately.
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <h2><b>Closing Thoughts</b></h2>

        <img src="images/Master/Picture2.JPG" width="500" height="300" alt="A beautiful picture">

        <p>In general, modelling high-dimensional heavy-tailed data can be very challenging, including both fitting
            the marginals and modelling the dependence structure across different marginals, and the problem can get
            even worse when there is not sufficient amount of data available. The AMA model which I have much
            experience working with is one example that can model such data, even though I personally believe it is too
            complex sometimes but not "reasonable" enough to model the data accurately and efficiently. The models in
            this project can be a good alternative, with the following advantages and disadvantages:
        </p>

        <p><h3><b>Advantages</b></h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Computationally efficient. No need for Monte Carlo simulations and saves tones of time.</li>
                <li>Stable. The Mixture Erlangs model is much more stable and avoids many
                    model selection procedures.</li>
                <li>Copula-free. This avoids the problem of copula selection and can potentially capture a
                    much broader range of dependence structures.</li>
                <li>Overall, the models here are much more FLEXIBLE in nature using mixtures, which I really think
                    is the major advantage compared to traditional insurance models.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>

          <p><h3><b>Disadvantages</b></h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Sometimes too good too be true. I have tried the models on various simulated datasets, one
                    perception is that the MULTIVARIATE part of the models can make it very challenging to model
                    the high-dimensional data when different marginals have very different TAIL BEHAVIOURS and
                    when there is very limited data to train the model. I think in such case, using a COPULA model
                    with EXTREME VALUE THEORY can be much more useful, and I have done this exercise in another project
                    which can be found in another page of the website.</li>
            </ul>
