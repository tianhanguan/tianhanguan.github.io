        <!-- Section 2 Personal Statement -->
        <h2 id="SUMMARY">Personal Information</h2>
        <p> I'm currently working for Canadian Imperial Bank of
            Commerce (CIBC)'s Marketing Analytics group, mainly responsible for performing analysis for direct
            marketing campaigns.

            In the past, I have worked for
            CIBC's Global Operational Risk Management group, responsible for the bank's operational risk capital
            modelling process using the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) model.

            I have also worked in the insurance industry (both life and property & casualty) as actuarial analyst
            during my co-op terms, where I mainly worked on model validation and catastrophe modelling
            projects. I passed all the preliminary exams from the Society of Actuaries (SOA) and the
            Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Module. <br/> <br/>

            I got my Master of Science degree in Statistical Sciences from the University of Toronto (2017-2019),
            and my Bachelor of Mathematics degree (co-op program) from the University of Waterloo (2011-2016), major in
            Actuarial Science (Finance option) and Statistics, minor in Applied Mathematics.

            Over the years, I have obtained solid background and work experience in applying
            Statistical and Machine Learning methods in quantitative analysis,
            especially under the topic of Quantitative Risk Management and Marketing Strategies. <br/> <br/>
        </p>

        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p> Currently I'm working in the Marketing Analytics group in CIBC (starting May 2019), where my job focuses on
            how to better understand and improve some of CIBC's direct marketing campaigns using analytical tools and
            methods. My job typically involves analyzing big and abstract dataset using machine learning, statistical,
            and data visualization tools and methods.

            Before this job, I used to work in CIBC's Global
            Operational Risk Management group (from Jan 2017 - Apr 2019), where I focused on how to model and analyze
            CIBC's operational risk capital numbers using the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) and other loss models.

            Other than that, I have also worked at Sun Life Financial (Model Validation & Analytics team) and
            Munich Reinsurance Company of Canada (Property & Casualty team) as a co-op actuarial analyst.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I did my Master of Science in Statistical Sciences from the University of Toronto, where I focused on
            quantitative risk management (in year 1) and machine learning & computational statistics (in year 2).
            I did my undergraduate study at the University of Waterloo, with a Bachelor of Mathematics in
            Actuarial Science (Finance option), Statistics, and Applied Mathematics in the Co-op program.
            I have passed all the preliminary exams from the Society of Actuaries (SOA) as well as the
            Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Module.
