        <!-- Section 2 Personal Statement -->
        <h2 id="SUMMARY">Personal Information</h2>
        <p> I'm currently working for Canadian Imperial Bank of
            Commerce (CIBC)'s Marketing Analytics group, mainly responsible for performing analysis for direct
            marketing campaigns.

            In the past, I have worked for
            CIBC's Global Operational Risk Management group, responsible for the bank's operational risk capital
            modelling process using the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) model.

            I have also worked in the insurance industry (both life and property & casualty) as actuarial analyst
            during my co-op terms, where I mainly worked on model validation and catastrophe modelling
            projects. I passed all the preliminary exams from the Society of Actuaries (SOA) and the
            Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Module. <br/> <br/>

            I did my Master of Science degree in Statistical Sciences from the University of Toronto (2017-2019),
            and my Bachelor of Mathematics degree (co-op program) from the University of Waterloo (2011-2016), major in
            Actuarial Science (Finance option) and Statistics, minor in Applied Mathematics.

            Over the years, I have obtained solid background and work experience in applying
            Statistical and Machine Learning methods in quantitative analysis,
            especially under the topic of Quantitative Risk Management. <br/> <br/>
