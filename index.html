        <p>Welcome to my personal website. I use this website to store a detailed version of my resume and
            keep track of some of the projects that I have accomplished already or planning to working on.
            I also include some other stuff which I'm interested in.</p>

        <h2 id="SUMMARY">Personal Information</h2>
        <p>My name is Tian Han Guan, you can also call me Eric.
            I'm currently working as a senior analyst at CIBC's Global Operational Risk Management group, leading the
            Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) capital modelling team.
            I'm also a graduate student in the
            Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto, pursuing my Master of Science in Statistics.
            My current interest is in how to apply Statistical and Machine Learning methods in quantitative analysis,
            especially under the topic of Quantitative Risk Management.
        </p>

        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p>I am currently a senior analyst working at Canadian Imperial Bank of
            Commerce (CIBC)'s Global Operational Risk Management group, leading the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA)
            capital modelling team, responsible for calculating and reporting CIBC's operational risk capital numbers on both
            monthly and quarterly basis. I have been working in this role since Jan 2017 (2 years since then).
        Before that, I have worked at Sun Life Financial (Model Validation & Analytics team) and Munich Reinsurance
            Company of Canada (Property & Casualty team) as a co-op actuarial analyst.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I'm currently a graduate student in the
            Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto, pursuing my Master of Science in Statistics.
            I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo,
        with a Bachelor of Mathematics in Actuarial Science, Statistics, and Applied Mathematics in the Co-op program.
        I am no longer pursing my actuarial credentials, but I have done quite a few actuarial exams/modules in the past.
        My current interest is in how to apply Statistical and Machine Learning methods in quantitative analysis,
            especially under the topic of Quantitative Risk Management.

        <h3>List of Courses Taken</h3>
        <p> I believe a solid background in mathematics, statistics, and programming are essential in most quantitative
        analysis tasks. The following is a subset of courses which I have done in the past.
