        <p>In recent years, extreme value theory (EVT) has been a popular topic not only in traditional natural science
            fields such as hydrology, but also in the finance and insurance industries. In summary, EVT can be considered
            as a general tool to model extreme or rare events such as a 1 in 100 year flood or a 1 in 1000 year economic
            stress scenario.  Even though EVT is a great theory to model extreme scenarios, apply the EVT can sometimes
            be difficult especially in the multivariate setting due to the loss of natural ordering in a
            multidimensional space. This term paper focuses on how to apply the peaks-over-threshold (POT)
            method of EVT in both the univariate and multivariate settings. The univariate problem focuses more
            on details of how to apply the POT method, while the multivariate problem focuses on how to
            capture the positive tail dependence structure using an extreme-value copula.
            Both problems use the same simulated dataset which is high-dimensional and heavy-tailed.

        <h2><b>Closing Thoughts</b></h2>

        <img src="images/EVT/Picture2.JPG" width="500" height="300" alt="A beautiful picture">

        <p>Modelling extreme data is usually very challenging, and one of the main reasons is that there is usually
            not enough data to train the models. The data scarcity problem gets even worse in high-dimensions as it is
            even more difficult to define what is an extreme data. From past experience, I did find it that in high
            dimensional setting, use a copula model is usually the best choice and which copula family to use sometimes
            has little impact on the result (which is surprising sometimes from a theoretical point of view).
