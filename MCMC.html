        <p>The autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model has become an important tool for modelling
            financial time series data, especially when the data exhibits some time-varying volatility clustering
            features. This project focuses on one particular category of the ARCH model,
            the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model,
            which is a popular choice in many financial econometric contexts.
            In particular, the project discusses how to fit a GARCH model
            using various Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as well as
            discussing the advantages and disadvantages between them and also 4
            comparing them to traditional fitting approaches such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods.

        <h2>Why use MCMC for model estimation?</h2>
        <p><b>Pitfalls of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach</b>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>The fitting results are very sensitive to the initial starting values and are very unstable in many cases</li>
                <li>A very large amount of data is needed in order to accurately estimate the parameters
                    (while in many cases large amount of historical data is not available)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Bayesian estimation using MCMC</h2>
        <p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Select a prior distribution.</li>
                <li>Compute the likelihood function and the joint density function.</li>
                <li>Derive the posterior distribution.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <hr/>


        <h2>Parameter estimation using MCMC algorithms</h2>
        <p>In this project, three different types of MCMC algorithms are performed on examples of GARCH(1,1) and
            GARCH(2,2) models.
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                <li>Random-Walk Metropolis algorithm</li>
                <li>Adaptive-Metropolis algorithm</li>
                <li>Parallel Tempered Metropolis algorithm</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

         <p>Both numerical and graphical analyses are used to assess the perform of each algorithm on the models.
         The Adaptive-Metropolis algorithm seems to perform best in both cases.</p>

        <h2><b>Closing Thoughts</b></h2>

        <img src="images/MCMC/Picture2.JPG" width="300" height="300" alt="A beautiful picture">

        <p>MCMC algorithms are very useful simulation techniques for high-dimensional computations,
            and are also important tools in machine learning. In this project, I only focus on random-walk MCMC
            algorithms due to the length of the report, another family of MCMC algorithms is the non-random walk MCMCs
            such as Hamiltonian MCMC and Langevin MCMC which use proposals that are more likely to be in the
            direction of higher probability density.
        </p>

        <p>One interesting point in this project is the choice of the prior. I have chosen to use the uniform prior
            (which is a non-informative prior) as I have no PRIOR ideas about the parameter values. It should be noted
            that in this case I'm still using a Bayesian approach rather than a Frequentist approach because
            when I adopt a uniform prior, I am still expressing an opinion on the parameter values.
